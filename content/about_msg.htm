Hello! This is a personal project owned by 
<a href="mailto:morrna@gmail.com">Nathan Morrison</a>.
I'm trying to teach myself how to use <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>,
 so I made this app as a scratchpad to test things.

If you have some weird desire to peak behind the curtain and see what I'm working on,
<a href="https://github.com/morrna/flailing-with-flask">
 you can get my code on GitHub</a>.
