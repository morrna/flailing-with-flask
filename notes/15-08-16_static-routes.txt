Changed /static/ folder to /content/, to prevent files from being exposed.

Static files are files whose routes in the app's filesystem are exposed
transparently to clients. This is useful for stylesheets and image files,
so I've read, but is not where I want to keep helper files for organizing
pieces of text etc.

It turns out that Google App Engine automatically recognizes a folder named
/static/ as a directory with the static_dir attribute, despite having no
entry in app.yaml. I was not able to find documentation of this fact, but
that is how it is behaving. The relevant page to start with for docs is:
