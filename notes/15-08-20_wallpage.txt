created new '/wall/' route to try forms

After reading up on forms in the Flask quickstart, I decided to start
implementing a simple wall for posting a limited number of messages so I could
get a hang of request objects and so on. I quickly became overwhelmed by trying
to figure out how to store the data, so for right now I settled on just leaving
the route with an "under construction" page.
