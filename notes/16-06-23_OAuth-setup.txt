Basic OAuth setup

Created OAuth2 credentials for project.
Excluded credentials from repo.
Excluded .gitignore from repo to keep files safe, and because I don't know a way to publish them if
they're not in this folder.
Created currently empty /oauth2callback path, which right now redirects to root.
