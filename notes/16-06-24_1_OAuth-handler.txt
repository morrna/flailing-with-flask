Set up handler for OAuth; as yet untested

/oauth2callback follows closely with form found here:
https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/web-app#example

I also created the 'current_resource' entry in fl.session .
The reasoning is that multiple pages should be able to redirect to /oauth2callback if needed, and
afterward the user should be directed back to where they left.
