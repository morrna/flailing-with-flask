Created simple_page template, discovered Flask's HTML escaping

I wrote simple_page to load some content inside of a div, and on first run
discovered that the content, which contained p and a tags, was not rendered.
All the characters had been escaped so that the tags showed up in the site text.
It turns out that Flask sets auto-escaping in Jinja2 by default when loading a
template that ends in htm or html. This is easily disabled by placing the 
'|safe' tag next to the variable name in the template.

This did get me thinking - maybe I'm going about organizing this wrong. Content
static to the site may be better passed around through template inheritance or 
HTML inclusion. Perhaps Python should only handle content that is truly
dynamic. Then again, it's not hard to mark which places in the template should
accept unescaped HTML input and which should not, so it might not be a problem
to pass HTML through Python if it's handled right. Sometime soon I should try to
find information about usage conventions to read up on.
